# Conventional Commit History for UI Overhaul

This documents the proper conventional commit format for the ui-overhaul branch work.

## Commit Format Standard

Following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (design system, formatting)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

## Proper Commit History for UI Overhaul

### Phase 1: Foundation & Audit
```bash
docs(audit): comprehensive UI/UX audit with 10 improvement areas identified

feat(design): implement Lattice tactical design system with Tailwind tokens
```

### Phase 2: 3D Map Implementation  
```bash
feat(map): replace 2D canvas with GPU-accelerated 3D terrain via deck.gl

feat(map): implement proper scale and camera controls with DPR support
```

### Phase 3: 3D Entities & Models
```bash
feat(models): add 3D infrastructure and aircraft entities via ScatterplotLayer

feat(overlays): implement Lattice-style tactical boundaries and sensor cones
```

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
```bash
perf(worker): offload EV/VOI calculations to Web Worker for 60fps target

feat(heatmaps): implement production-quality heatmaps with d3 color schemes
```

### Phase 5: Layout & Interactions
```bash
feat(layout): implement Lattice four-zone professional architecture

style(polish): add professional micro-interactions removing AI-made feel
```

### Phase 6: Quality Assurance
```bash
test(qa): comprehensive QA framework with performance budgets and CI integration
```

## Benefits of Conventional Commits

1. **Automated Changelog Generation**: Tools can parse commits to generate changelogs
2. **Semantic Versioning**: Commits can trigger version bumps automatically
3. **Clear History**: Easy to understand what changed and why
4. **Team Communication**: Standardized format improves team collaboration
5. **Tooling Integration**: Works well with CI/CD and release automation

## Scope Guidelines

- `map`: Changes to the 3D map rendering system
- `models`: 3D entity models and infrastructure
- `overlays`: Tactical overlays (boundaries, sensors, etc.)
- `layout`: UI layout and panel architecture  
- `theme`: Design system, colors, typography
- `worker`: Web Worker performance optimizations
- `polish`: Micro-interactions and visual polish
- `qa`: Quality assurance and testing framework
- `audit`: UI/UX auditing and analysis
